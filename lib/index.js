// dsh-computer-use — DSH Cordis plugin
//
// Native DSH integration for computer use. Mirrors the @anweat/dsh-browser
// plugin pattern: settings registration, a pure-function policy gate hooked
// into tools/pre-execute, and defineTool() registrations from
// @deepseek-ai/dsh-tools. All heavy lifting lives in
// lib/core (native worker + SoM + audit), inlined for portable installation.
//
// Approval mapping (see lib/policy.js):
//   read-only      → observation only, actuation denied
//   standard       → observation allowed, every actuation asks (harness approval UI)
//   autonomous     → actuation allowed except high-risk ops (still asks)
//   unrestricted   → everything allowed (worker failsafe corner + rate limit remain)
//
// Two out-of-band behaviours live here rather than in the tool layer, because both are
// triggered by things that happen while the MODEL is not calling anything:
//
//   1. THE BRAKE IS ANNOUNCED INTO THE SESSION. The native worker's low-level keyboard hook
//      fires the instant the human hits ESC / Ctrl+Alt+Q and writes an unsolicited NDJSON
//      event; that event is steered into the running session, so the model learns it was
//      stopped mid-turn instead of on the human's NEXT message (2026-09-13 requirement).
//      It cannot go through `tools/pre-execute`: PreToolDecision is {kind:'allow'|'deny'|'ask'}
//      only — that hook has no message channel at all.
//   2. THE ACTIVITY BORDER IS CUT INSTANTLY WHEN THE TURN ENDS (`agent/status` → idle), so a
//      lingering blue border can never claim the machine is still being driven.

 *

 *   `[session-store] session/event listener threw: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'kind')`
 *   `[agent-loop]   agent event "agent/inbox/claimed" listener threw: TypeError: ... reading 'kind'`
 * Both were swallowed by this plugin's own `try`, so the ONLY symptom was "选1之后崩溃".
 *
 * The shape is the one the harness itself uses (`createUserMessage({content, source})` → a message with
 * `{id, role:'user', content, source}`); the dynamic import is tried first so the real constructor owns
 * identity and freezing, and the hand-built fallback keeps the SAME four fields — the field that must
 * never be missing is `source.kind`. This function was previously nested inside `apply()` and used only
 * by `notice()`; it moved here so the card's branches cannot drift back to a bare object.

// side the agent simply FREEZES with no visible reason, and the turn stalls until they happen to
// look. A pending input is useless if it is behind another window.
//
// COVERAGE — every surface where an agent turn blocks on a human:
//   * `user-questions/request` — the waterfall `ctx.userQuestions.ask()` runs; this is what
//     `ask_user_question` blocks on, and it is the ONLY path a question card can take (read from
//     @deepseek-ai/dsh-user-questions). Fires for every question surface, whatever the UI.
//   * `approval/asked` — a Host tool approval, the pre-existing case. Kept unchanged.
//   Both listeners are installed on the ROOT ctx AND inside the desktopRuntime-injected child,
//   because a scoped waterfall (`scopeTarget(agent, agent)`) is delivered to the matching scope:
//   whichever of the two sees it raises the window, and a dedupe window makes the pair idempotent.
//
// HOW: the launcher's own `desktopRuntime.show()` path (restore + show + focus). It is called ONLY
// when Desktop is not already the foreground window, so a human already looking at the chat is

// package does NOT make it readable: the host's only discovery path is
// `@deepseek-ai/dsh-skill-filesystem`, which scans `<project>/.dsh/skills`,
// `<project>/.agents/skills`, configured custom dirs, `<dshHome>/skills` and `<agentsHome>/skills` —
// never `node_modules`. So a user who installs this plugin without ALSO copying the skill into
// `<dshHome>/skills` gets driving tools locked by a receipt from a manual that nothing serves, and
// the gate's own hint points at a path no provider can read. That is a release-breaking trap, and the
// host has a documented seam for exactly this case: `ctx.skills.register()` contributes an in-memory
// ("embedded") skill whose body is served from this package.
//
// WHY NOT IN `inject`: a service listed in `inject` that never resolves leaves the whole fiber
// INACTIVE and `apply` never runs at all (see the long note under `export const inject` below). The
// skill is an enhancement, never a precondition for the tools, so it goes through the same lazy
// `ctx.inject` seam the question service uses and degrades to one log line when the service is absent.
//
// A FILESYSTEM COPY STILL WINS WHERE ONE EXISTS: the registry resolves one name per layer by rank, so

  // to BRANCH, not just stop. The shipped code implemented only the stop half and said so in a comment;
  // the human asked why. It is a setting because the judgement is theirs to set up ONCE, rather than the
  // agent improvising it at every timeout.
  //   'stop'      — the timer makes NO decision: the machine stays with the human, the cycle stays open.
  //   'recommended' — the timer executes the choice the CARD DECLARED as its recommendation. Note this is
  //                   a judgement about the AGENT's next turn, never about the machine: it does not close
  //                   the cycle and it does not release a human's brake.
  // WHETHER THERE IS A RECOMMENDATION IS NOT CONFIGURED — IT IS READ FROM THE TASK (2026-09-15).
  // A `turnEndAutoContinueMax` counter existed here for one revision; the human rejected it ("由且仅由问题
  // 任务的情形决定，而不是几次 … 不应该这样硬编码设计"). The branch is now decided per turn by whether a real
  // actuation reached the worker in that turn (see `turnSituation`), so there is no budget to configure.

  // would stay null for the process lifetime and EVERY turn-end card would be refused silently.

  // ---- THE AGENT EVERY QUESTION MUST NAME (2026-09-15) -----------------------------------------
  // MEASURED FAILURE, not a theory. The turn-end card was dispatched and the host answered
  //   22:57:16.836  turn-end card: NO ANSWER (NO_PROVIDER) — nothing steered, no choice was made
  // and no card was ever rendered — while the raiser itself worked fine (two seconds later it logged
  // "Desktop already in front for pending question (1 question(s): computer_use_turn_end)").
  //
  // CAUSE (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-remotes/lib/index.js:115-124`): the remote forwarder that carries a
  // question to the browser's card is a WATERFALL listener that begins
  //     const carrierAgent = carrierKeyOf(this); if (carrierAgent === void 0) return next();
  // so an agent-LESS request is never forwarded to the client's answerer
  // (`dsh-client-ui-user-questions/lib/client.js:880`). Nobody accepts, and the service rejects with
  // NO_PROVIDER. `dsh-user-questions/README.zh.md:41` says the same thing in words: "Web 回答者只接收带
  // Agent scope 的请求；不含 agent 的程序化请求仍会交给本地未限定 scope 的 waterfall listener，若无人
  // 接受则以 NO_PROVIDER 失败." The host's own `ask_user_question` always passes `agent: exec.agent`.
  //
  // WHY NOT SIMPLY PASS `bus.agent`: `ask()` validates it (`lib/index.js:56-60`) — it must be the
  // registry's EXACT live instance (`agents.get(a.id) === a`, else CALLER_NOT_LIVE) AND a live ROOT
  // (`agents.roots().includes(a)`, else DELEGATED_CALLER). `bus.agent` is the last tool caller, which
  // is right in practice but unverified, and a wrong agent fails in exactly the same silent way this
  // whole bug did. So the caller is verified FIRST and only replaced when the registry disapproves —
  // and every replacement is logged, so a fallback can never masquerade as the normal path.
  //
  // "LIVE ROOT" IS NOT ENOUGH — IT MUST BE THE ROOT OF THIS SESSION (found by RUNNING this function,
  // 2026-09-15, not by reading it). Liveness and rootness say nothing about WHICH chat the card is
  // for: another session's live root passed both checks and was returned as `verified`, so a turn that
  // ended in THIS chat could raise its card in another one. `session` is therefore part of the test,
  // and a candidate that is a live root of some OTHER session is treated as rejected — never adopted
  // merely because the registry does not object.

  // ---- THE "CARD LOOP" HAD A DIFFERENT CAUSE, AND A SUPPRESSION FLAG WAS THE WRONG FIX -----------
  // Measured at 23:22: selecting 继续 produced the card again 2 s later, and again 5 s after that, until
  // the human cancelled it (`NO ANSWER (ASK_CANCELLED)`). A `suppressCardForTurn` flag was added for
  // that — and the re-audit showed it was BACKWARDS, from the turn-end diagnostic file:
  //
  //   15:22:12.724Z CARD … ask=yes via=verified        ← the card the human answered
  //   15:22:23.039  TypeError … reading 'kind'          ← the steer's bare object crashed the round
  //   15:22:23.048Z FIRED kind=error / CARD …           ← 10 ms later — an ERRORED turn, not a new one
  //   15:22:30.588Z FIRED kind=error / CARD …
  //
  // There was never an echo: 继续 → crash → the turn ended as `kind=error` → a card for the errored turn.
  // The flag could not have suppressed that anyway — `steer` wakes the driver, the loop appends
  // `turn/start` immediately, and the `turn/start` handler cleared the flag before the card ever read it.
  // So it suppressed the case it was not meant to touch (a normal card-steered turn, where the human DOES
  // want to be asked) and could never fire for the case that actually looped. It is REMOVED rather than
  // repaired: the driver of that loop was the message-shape crash, and that is fixed at its source.
  //
  // WHAT DOES REMAIN TRUE: an errored turn raises the same decision card. That is deliberate — the human
  // should still decide what happens to the machine — but the card now SAYS the turn errored, so it is
  // not mistaken for an ordinary completion.
  // THERE IS NO machine-wide suppression flag here. If a future measurement shows a genuine echo, it must
  // be bound to (sessionKey, turn) and justified by evidence of that shape — not by this one.

  let inFlight = 0
  // Ctrl+Alt+Q cancels the turn ON PURPOSE. The abort that follows must never be mistaken for
  // the human hitting the stop button — that rule below re-armed the brake and left the red
  // border burning on screen after an exit (reported 2026-09-12).
  let selfAbortUntil = 0
  // Did THIS TURN already receive the "read the procedure" nudge? Reset at turn/start — the manual
  // is per-turn knowledge, not per-session state.
  let nudgedTurn = false
  // Did THIS TURN already open a computer-use cycle? Reset at turn/start, next to nudgedTurn —
  // same reason, same axis: a cycle belongs to a turn, not to a session.
  // NOTE (2026-09-13): the module-wide `cycleOpenedThisTurn` boolean is GONE. It was reset by ANY
  // session's turn/start (a host-wide event) and never set on the normal path, so it both leaked
  // across sessions and failed to stop a same-turn resurrection. lib/cycle.js now keeps the
  // qualification per (session, agent, turn) and consumes it on the first call of that turn.

  // ---- OPENING THE CYCLE WHERE THE CALL ACTUALLY HAPPENS ----------------------------------------
  //
  // THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR (measured 2026-09-13, host log dsh-2026-09-13.log): a machine-wide
  // `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dsh-computer-use\EXITED` record outlives every process, and exactly ONE thing
  // clears it — the worker op `resume`. The plugin used to send that op only from the `turn/start`
  // branch below, gated on the turn belonging to `bus.driverSession`, which is only ever set by a
  // PREVIOUS session's tool call. So a BRAND-NEW session's first turn always failed `mine`:
  //   01:17:44.287  EXITED written (Ctrl+Alt+Q)
  //   01:19:51.641  a new session started its first turn — bus.driverSession still named the OLD
  //                 session → mine === false → resume() never sent
  //   01:19:55.033  its first computer_* call finally set bus.driverSession (too late: the boundary
  //                 had already passed)
  //   01:21:34.627  its first DRIVING call was refused: CYCLE-ENDED — and the agent then told the
  //                 human "you pressed Ctrl+Alt+Q".
  // A new session could therefore NEVER re-open computer use, and the turn boundary — a host-wide
  // event that says nothing about who is about to touch this machine — was the wrong place to decide.
  //
  // The right place is the call that is about to reach the worker. `ensureCycle` is awaited from the
  // ONE dispatch point every computer_* invocation passes through exactly once (lib/tools.js, the
  // `reg()` wrapper around every tool's execute), BEFORE the op is written to the worker's stdin, so
  // the ordering is enforced by an `await` in the same async chain rather than by a race between a
  // host event and a tool call. The latch makes it once per turn.
  //
  // A BRAKE IS NOT AN EXITED LATCH (hard rule — a human's brake must never be cleared by this):
  //   * only `resume` may be sent, and the worker's `resume` is `Panic.AgentCalling()`, which
  //     touches the EXITED latch ONLY — it does not clear `_engaged`/`_stopped` and does not delete
  //     the STOP file, so Ctrl+Alt+R stays the human's alone;
  //   * and this refuses to run at all while a brake is up (`cu.stopped` from the worker's `panic`
  //     event, or the persisted STOP latch), because the core's `resume()` also mirrors the state
  //     locally (`this.stopped = false`) — calling it under a brake would drift the plugin's view
  //     from the worker's while the worker still refused every actuation.
  // THE CYCLE GATE (2026-09-13, A+B from the Codex review). lib/cycle.js holds identity, ownership
  // and the per-turn qualification; this file only feeds it events and asks it, at the ONE dispatch
  // point every computer_* call passes through, whether this call may drive.

  // ONE place decides both, so the card's text and the timer's behaviour cannot disagree — which is the
  // defect the human caught: the card promised "I will not start an unattended turn" while the design
  // words they remembered promised a branch.
  //
  // ---- AND THE BRANCH IS DECIDED BY THE TASK SITUATION, NOT BY A COUNTER ---------------------------
  // The first implementation capped consecutive automatic continuations with a config number (default 2).
  // The human rejected that design in one sentence: "由且仅由问题任务的情形决定，而不是几次。你现在刚我说
  // 是两次，不应该这样硬编码设计." They are right, and the counter also solved the wrong problem: it rationed
  // the TIMER, when what decides the branch is whether the work is still going.
  //
  // SO THE SITUATION IS READ FROM THE TASK, ONCE PER TURN:
  //   * `turnSituation.action = true` — an actuation really reached the worker during this turn, so the task
  //     was mid-motion when the turn ended. There IS somewhere to continue to.
  //   * nothing was dispatched — the turn was observation, an error, or a wrap-up. There is nothing to
  //     continue TO, so the timer makes no decision. That is the human's own rule, not a cap.
  // It is written by the `onDispatch` hook (see `hooks`), which fires at the last statement before the tool
  // body in `tools.js` — after every refusal has thrown — so "dispatched" is a fact, not an intention.
  //
  // ---- AND IT BELONGS TO ONE SESSION, NOT TO THE MACHINE (2026-09-16) ------------------------------
  // `turn/start` is a HOST-WIDE event, so a turn starting in another chat would clear this value — and the
  // mirror case is worse: chat A drives the machine, chat B starts a turn, chat A's turn ends, and A's card
  // carries a recommendation read from a machine-wide flag. `owner` names the session the situation
  // describes, and the timer only trusts it for that session.
  //

  // `const` from its temporal dead zone is a run-time error waiting for the first driving call.

  // something. So the guard is a COMPARISON between two situations:
  //   * `lastDrive` is the tool sequence that justified the last automatic continuation;
  //   * if the next turn's sequence is IDENTICAL and the human has not answered in between, continuing is
  //     not progress — the same thing was done again — so the timer stops and says so.
  // It accumulates nothing, hardcodes no number, and any real progress changes the sequence. Its honest
  // weakness: a task that legitimately repeats one identical step would stop one iteration early — which
  // is the conservative direction, because the card is still raised and the human decides.

    // WHAT WENT WRONG. A human brake (ESC, a mouse shake, the wheel, typing outside the host) engaged
    // the brake and steered a "WRAP UP NOW" notice into the turn — but `agent.steer` only delivers at a
    // STEP BOUNDARY, so a turn already inside a long or in-flight call never read it, and OBSERVATION
    // calls kept succeeding while paused (`worker.cs:2401`: "the brake stops CONTROL, not
    // OBSERVATION"). The result the human actually saw, twice, in their own words: "卡停就是让你停住,
    // 关键是你没停啊? 你还在思考中啊" — the brake stopped the MACHINE while the agent kept walking,
    // because there was always one more legal step to take.
    //
    // THE FIX IS NOT TO CANCEL THE TURN (that was offered and rejected): the human's design is
    // "让我在知道我触发红框暂停之后快速收尾" — wrap up QUICKLY, not die silently. So every computer_*
    // call made while the brake is up is refused AT THE ONLY DOOR THEY ALL USE (registerTools' `reg`),
    // and the refusal itself carries the wrap-up directive. The instruction therefore arrives as the
    // RESULT of the call the model is already making — no step boundary to wait for, nothing to miss.
    //
    // Observations are refused too, deliberately. Leaving them open is what made "wrap up" optional:
    // the model could always take one more look, and did. The cost is real and accepted — the agent
    // cannot inspect the frozen screen to describe it — so the refusal names the brake's reason, which
    // is the one fact it would have gone looking for.
    //
    // `asking` is NOT refused: a question is the safety direction and the card is the answer surface.
    // `ended` is left to the cycle gate, which already owns that verdict.
    // SAFETY-DIRECTION EXEMPTIONS, and they are NOT optional: `computer_ctrl`, `computer_ask` and
    // `computer_batch` all go through the SAME `reg` wrapper, so a blanket refusal while paused would
    // have blocked the very tools the human needs in a stop — `computer_ctrl`'s `exit` (Ctrl+Alt+Q's

      // 再说，关闭整个周期，还是继续"). The old worry that motivated auto-closing ("不能让正常完成一律保留成
      // 永远活着") is now handled by the card: an explicit branch, or the timeout default, ends it.
      // A pause/ask still keeps the cycle alive for Ctrl+Alt+R, unchanged.
      // ---- A TURN THAT NEVER TOUCHED THE MACHINE IS NOT A COMPUTER-USE SUSPENSION (defect, 2026-09-16) --
      // THE DEATH LOOP THIS CLOSES, in the human's own words: "你卡进死循环了 不断弹卡片". Measured in
      // `turn-end-diag.log`: eleven cards in two and a half minutes (02:38:03 → 02:40:40), every one of them
      // `kind=error`, and the session transcript says why —
      //   turn 146…156  reason={"kind":"error","error":{"message":"Insufficient Balance","code":"QUOTA"}}
      // The account was out of credit, so EVERY turn died at step 1. Each death ended a turn, the turn-end
      // gate asked for a decision about a MACHINE THAT HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED, the human answered, and their
      // answer started another turn that died the same way. The card was not wrong about the machine; it was
      // answering a question nobody had asked, about a machine that was idle, forever.
      // The honest predicate is already on hand: `turnSituation.seq` is the turn's own dispatch signature
      // (every `computer_*` call the turn actually dispatched — see `hooks.onDispatch`). Empty means this
      // turn never reached the machine, so there is no cycle decision to make and the card must not fire. A
      // billing error, a provider outage or a chat-only turn is reported by the host's own "本轮运行失败";
      // dressing it as a machine decision is what produced the loop.
      // It also keeps the human's standing rule intact: "一旦挂起，任何挂起，都必须进入卡片" — a suspension
      // OF THE MACHINE still always gets its card, and now a turn that suspended nothing no longer fakes one.
      //
      // THE RESIDUAL RISK, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: `turnSituation` is ONE slot and `turn/start` is a
      // host-wide event, so if another session (a background subagent, another chat) starts a turn between
      // this turn's last dispatch and its end, that start resets `seq` and this gate then suppresses a card
      // the owner had earned. The failure direction is the safe one — no card, the cycle stays open, and the
      // machine was never touched by anyone in the meantime — and `recommendContinueNow` has depended on the
      // same single slot since it was written. Making it exact means keying the situation BY SESSION, which
